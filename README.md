# ABXD 2 BlargBoard database converter
This little app will make your database and settings and config info work with BlargBoard.

this is a work in progress and isnt done

luckily its actaully very easy to make as ABXD shares the same table layout for a lot of things with BB

# How to use
First, make a backup of the board's database and its config folder. Next go into the config folder and open salt.php. you should get something like this:
`<?php $salt = "thesalt" ?>`
Copy the text inside the quotation marks. You will need it later

# ABXD/BlargBoard database converter
This little app will make your database and settings and config info work with BlargBoard.

This is a work in progress and isn't done

Luckily, it's actaully very easy to make as ABXD shares the same table layout for a lot of things with BB

# How to use
First, make a backup of the board's database and your website, especially the config folder.            
Next, delete everything from your install execpt the config, (OPTIONAL: and the themes) folder.              
Then, download a copy of [BlargBoard 1.2](https://github.com/maorninja/BlargBoard/) and extract everything to the place where your ABXD install was.                 
After that, download this repo and extract it to the root of your board install folder.                  
Then go to /convert.php in your web browser and follow the on screen instructions.

For the plugins, go to the [WWXD Repo](https://github.com/WWXD/addons/)          
To convert the themes, change #body to body.
